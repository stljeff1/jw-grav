You could view any single video but viewing additional videos required signing up for the companys newsletter.\r\n\r\nThe application was a single page app, with each video having its own route. Each video was displayed via the Youtube API."

For 18 months, I contracted with Singing Success to build out UIs, manage Search Engine presence, and perform routine deployments. The site lived on a NodeJS server leveraging Gulp and Stylus for asset management, and AngularJS 1.* on the front-end. My main responsibilities included translating mock ups and wireframes in search engine friendly pages, complete with Rich Data Snippets.
