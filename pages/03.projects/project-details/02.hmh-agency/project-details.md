The HMH Agency project was an ambitious Wordpress project - ambitious meaning the site required lots of custom post types and lots of custom behaviors. They needed a bright and unique site to showcase all of their work. I worked closely with the HMH team to flush out content requirements for each post type, ensuring that the team had everything they needed to add to the site.

Featured on this site is a [masonry-type grid](https://hmhagency.com/work/), [parallax-type scrolling](https://hmhagency.com/case-study/palmetto-bluff-living-high-in-the-low-country/) to tell stories, and lots of [use of CSS Flexbox](https://hmhagency.com/blog/just-the-ticket-or-in-this-case-the-card/).
