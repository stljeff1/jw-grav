Brenda Carolan is an ambitious and intuitiuve entreprenuer who needed a modern website that could support her growing business and new brand identity. The project demanded a strong E-commerce solution that could be flexible and reshaped quickly. I leveraged [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/), a Wordpress plugin that gives the developer the ability to write view templates using [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).	I really enjoyed using Twig in this project, as it help to keep my server side code out of my view templates, which allowed me to be flexible in my template development. 

This project was also my first time using [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/). For this project, I implemented an AJAX-based solution for adding items to the cart, customized WooCommerce category pages, and developed my own custom blocks to use in Wordpress's [new Gutenberg editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/).
