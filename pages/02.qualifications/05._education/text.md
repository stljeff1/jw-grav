I attended [Christopher Newport University](http://www.cnu.edu) in Newport News, Virginia. I graduated in 2005 with a BS/BA in Information Systems, Business Administration concentration

During my four years at CNU, I worked as a web developer every year while taking a full course load and maintaining a 3.0 GPA. For three years, I supported the university's website and intranet under the supervision of the school's webmaster. In my final year, I undertook an internship at a student-led program at NASA's Langley Airforce Base. I managed the website for the nationwide internship program, which required strict adherance to NASA's branding standards.
