First introduced to HTML and CSS in 1999, I quickly latched on to the technologies, knowing immediately that these are the tools I will use to sustain my livlihood. Back then, there were few standards in place. The idea of seperation between content and presentation were non-existent. Cross-browser compatibility gave me nightmares.

Today, there exists a plethora of tools available to make websites. Good standards are quickly adopted on a mass scale. Copywriters can operate independently of designers, and collaboration within cross-functional teams happens effortlessly if given the right foundation.

However, my challenge as a web developer remains the same. 

<blockquote> <p>How do I get <b>"target audience"</b> to act upon <b>"call-to-action-item"</b> and produce a <b>"conversion"</b>.</p></blockquote>

<p class='text-center lead red-text'>But What does it all mean</p>

In the [wide spectrum of expert fields of the web industry](https://css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/), I have chosen to be a Front End Developer because that is the area where my talents for problem solving, adaptabily, and empowerment are best utilized. I get the opportunity to work with designers, back end programmers, and business leaders, which in turn broadens my perspectives. Additionally, I enjoy the challenge of empathizing with the end user of websites, taking into consideration what device are they using, where are they, and what did they have for breakfast?
