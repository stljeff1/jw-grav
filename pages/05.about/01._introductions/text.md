What shall I say about myself? Well, most of all, know that I build websites. No, I'm not a designer. No, I don't know how to hack the government. I am somewhere in between - I'm a Front-End Developer.

I have chosen to be a Front End Developer because that is the area where my talents for problem solving, adaptabily, and empowerment are best utilized.
